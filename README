Sessions are stores of information kept on the server that 
persist across page loads
this is to be used with Gary Burd's Twister, and functions as a middleware handler

install with:
goinstall github.com/nstott/session

in your server init, run something like:

	server.Run(":8080",
		SessionHandler(NewMemoryStore(),
		web.NewRouter().
		Register("/", "GET", index).
...


you can manipulate session data as follows
	var val int
	var f float64
	var s string

	Get(req, "float64", &f)
	Set(req, "float64", f + .1)

	Get(req, "string", &s)
	Set(req, "string", s + ".")

	Get(req,"counter2", &val)
	Set(req, "counter2", val + 1)
